         <ul>
            <li>
               Explain the motivation for your application. What can it allow
               someone to understand?
            </li>
            <li>
               1 section on the data: Describe the data and include a link.
            </li>
            <li>
               1 section on the visualization components: Explain each view of
               the data, the GUI, etc. Explain how you can interact with your
               application, and how the views update in response to these
               interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
               This time, include a section with your design sketches and design
               justifications.
            </li>
            <li>
               1 section on what your application enables you to discover:
               Present some findings you arrive at with your application.
            </li>
            <li>
               1 section on your process- what libraries did you use? How did
               you structure your code? How can you access it and run it? Link
               to your code (and the live application, if it is deployed
               online).
            </li>
            <li>
               Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your application in
               action. The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture
               tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime. Use a
               voiceover or video captions to explain your application. Demo
               videos should be sufficient on their own, but can reference your
               documentation. Include the name of the project, your name, the
               project components, and how your application works. You can
               present it on your webpage or on youtube, but linked on your
               webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
               This time, document who on your team did which component of the
               project. Ex. If someone worked on the data, and on bar charts,
               list their effort on these components.
