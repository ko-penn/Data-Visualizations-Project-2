         <ul>
            <li>
               Explain the motivation for your application. What can it allow
               someone to understand?
            </li>
            <li>
               1 section on the data: Describe the data and include a link.
            </li>
            <li>
               1 section on the visualization components: Explain each view of
               the data, the GUI, etc. Explain how you can interact with your
               application, and how the views update in response to these
               interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
               This time, include a section with your design sketches and design
               justifications.
            </li>
            <li>
               1 section on what your application enables you to discover:
               Present some findings you arrive at with your application.
            </li>
            <li>
               1 section on your process- what libraries did you use? How did
               you structure your code? How can you access it and run it? Link
               to your code (and the live application, if it is deployed
               online).
            </li>
            <li>
               Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your application in
               action. The easiest way to record this is with a screen capture
               tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime. Use a
               voiceover or video captions to explain your application. Demo
               videos should be sufficient on their own, but can reference your
               documentation. Include the name of the project, your name, the
               project components, and how your application works. You can
               present it on your webpage or on youtube, but linked on your
               webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
               This time, document who on your team did which component of the
               project. Ex. If someone worked on the data, and on bar charts,
               list their effort on these components.

                  Our visualizations allow users to see ufo sightings
                  distributed through time and space. Users can also seek
                  answers to certain questions they may have. For example, how
                  many ufo sightings have there been in my home town in the last
                  5 years. The frequency charts allow for easy discovery of

                  For libraries we used d3js, d3-cloud, and leaflet. d3 was
                  mainly used in building the bar charts and allowed for
                  brushing techniques. d3-cloud was specifically for generating
                  the word cloud and similarly leaflet was used specifically for
                  the map.

                           First our main function collects all the data from
                           the csv, processes said data, then initializes all
                           the charts and event listeners.

                           The processData function loops over all the rawData
                           from the csv and does some type casting and build
                           some calculated fields like the totd, season, year,
                           month, hour, and other fields we are interested in

                           hideFrequencyCategoriesWithoutData toggle is changed,

                           We also had a globals file that stored all global
                           variables that would be shared across different chart
                           types. These variables include the rawData from the
                           csv, the processedData which is the rawData with
                           calculated fields and type casting, then the actual
                           data which is the filtered down version of the

                           instances. This makes it easier to access any chart
                           from anywhere in the code and makes it especially
                           easy to trigger updateVis method from other chart
                           interactions.

                           Finally, there were also a few helper functions
                           defined globally. The main two of note are the
                           updateAllVis and handleGlobalFilterChange. These
                           functions handle calling the updateVis/updateData on
                           all the charts, and applying new filtering logic to
                           the processedData to send to the chart instances on
                           some brush selections or timeline change. Another
                           interesting concept is debouncing the
                           handleGlobalFilterChange. Because all the charts call
                           this, making sure frequent potentially duplicated
                           calls dont trigger unessecary processing, a debounce
                           was implemented to basically wait 50ms after a call
                           to this method is made and if no new call is made in
                           that time it does the processing.

                  Of course there are lots of more interesting areas, such as
                  the chart implementations themselves and how the timeline
                  plays on a setInterval, but I will leave that for you to
                  investigate in our sourcecode!

                  and run it simply in VSCode with the live preview extension on
                  the index.html file. You can also see the live version

                  Include a 2-3 minute demo video, showing your application in
                  action. The easiest way to record this is with a screen
                  capture tool, which also captures audio- such as Quicktime.
                  Use a voiceover or video captions to explain your application.
                  Demo videos should be sufficient on their own, but can
                  reference your documentation. Include the name of the project,
                  your name, the project components, and how your application
                  works. You can present it on your webpage or on youtube, but
                  linked on your webpage.
